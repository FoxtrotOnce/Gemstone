# Automatic player for Jewel Quest III
This program uses image recognition to analyze Jewel Quest III levels, and automatically play the to the best of its ability.
### This program will move your mouse, so beware!!

# Using it
You can either start the program from inside a level (the gems are already loaded), or the overview of a level before you go into it.
If you start the program from inside a level, Gemstone must have not been on any other levels prior.

Currently, it uses an algorithm to calculate the best move to make each turn, and then performs that move.
Once a level is complete, **move your mouse to the corner of the screen** to stop it from running.
